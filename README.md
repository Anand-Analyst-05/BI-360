🔗 [Live Report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMzRjNGM1ZWMtODAzOC00YTExLWE3NDAtOWFlMzhkM2NmOTU1IiwidCI6ImM2ZTU0OWIzLTVmNDUtNDAzMi1hYWU5LWQ0MjQ0ZGM1YjJjNCJ9)

## 🧠 Project Summary

AtliQ Hardware was struggling with fragmented, messy data across its departments. Finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain teams worked in silos — and decision-making was slower than it should’ve been.

So I built **Business Insights 360**, a Power BI dashboard that integrates over **1.8 million rows** of data from Excel, CSV, and MySQL sources.

Now, their leadership gets clear, real-time insights. Fewer blind spots. Faster decisions.
